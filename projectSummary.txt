As far as we know, everything works.
All eleven instructions run successfully, in particular as they are written in instructionMemory2016.
Changes to make this a multicycle datapath:
1. Combined data memory and instruction memory into combined memory.
2. Implement lw and sw to take 2 clock cycles, but every other instruction takes 1 clock cycle.
