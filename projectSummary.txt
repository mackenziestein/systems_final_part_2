As far as we know, everything works.
In particular, all 11 instructions work as specified in the instructionMemory2016.sv file.

Changes to make this a multicycle datapath:
1. Combined data memory and instruction memory into combined memory.
2. Implement lw, sw, and bleu to take 2 clock cycles, but every other instruction takes 1 clock cycle.
3. Eliminated the adder that was formerly used for PCBranch (bleu), and instead compute the branch address in the ALU and save it in a register, to be retrieved if branch condition is satisfied on the next clock tick.
