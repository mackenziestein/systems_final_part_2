As far as we know, everything works other than rolv.  Based on how we had encoded it before, it will not work here unless we completely change our encoding.  We have not done that yet.

Changes to make this a multicycle datapath:
1. Combined data memory and instruction memory into combined memory.
2. Implement lw and sw to take 2 clock cycles, but every other instruction takes 1 clock cycle.
